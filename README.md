# Radeon
An undetected Discord Token Logger.
## Does it work?
Updated `2021-12-25`: Works and isn't detected by Malwarebytes nor Defender as far as I can tell.
## Can it be extended to different types of malware?
Yeah, but as it's made with Unity, it takes some extra effort to get certain functionality working.

I take no responsibility for what you do with this, it's made for educational purposes only.
