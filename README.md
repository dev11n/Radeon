# Radeon
An undetected Discord Token Logger.
## Does it work?
Updated `Jul 29, 2022`: Defender seems to have started detecting it, making it UD again shouldn't be too difficult though for any non-script kiddie.

If you want to try it, you have to update the webhook url in `Webhook.cs`.
## Can it be extended to different types of malware?
Yeah, but as it's made with Unity, it takes some extra effort to get certain functionality working.
